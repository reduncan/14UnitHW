# ToDo - Live (MySQL)

Design a To-Do application that utilizes MySQL for storing to-dos.

### MVP

- Use array methods instead of for loops
- Make a GET route for getting all todo list items
- Make a POST route for adding a new todo list item
- Make a PUT route for updating a todo list item when it is checked
- Make a DELETE route for deleting a todo list item only  after it has been checked as compeleted
- Modularize your routes by seperating your Express routes into a seperate route file
- No global variables other than functions and state (front-end)
- Use a single render function to render items to the page (front-end)
- Use AJAX (part of the jQuery library) to make GET, POST, PUT, and DELETE requests from the front-end
- Use a MySQL database hosted on Heroku
- Use the Sequelize Node module to connect with the MySQL database
- The to do list items must be stored in MySQL and can not be stored in your Node application
